That is, it was not possible to display folder contents but the complete file name and path had to be guessed. Due to the lack of a comprehensive website I was forced to gather information from various different sources.
In this blog post, I want to summarize my findings and focus on the exploitation ofÂ this kind of vulnerability.</description></item></channel></rss>
