    <description><![CDATA[After the seminal blog post by James Jardine in 2016 on XXE exploitation in .NET applications back in 2016, Microsoft seems to have implemented some additional changes regarding the default behavior of XML parsers.
We work through the different XML methods provided and their corresponding vulnerable configurations. For all experiments, .NET framework 4.6 was chosen.
TL;DR  In order to create an XXE vulnerability for applications using .NET framework 4.6+, you have to instantiate a vulnerable XmlResolver beforehand.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In a recent engagement I was confronted with a blind path traversal vulnerability on a server running with the Microsoft Windows operating system. That is, it was not possible to display folder contents but the complete file name and path had to be guessed. Due to the lack of a comprehensive website I was forced to gather information from various different sources.
In this blog post, I want to summarize my findings and focus on the exploitation ofÂ this kind of vulnerability.]]></description>
