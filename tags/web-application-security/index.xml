<p>We work through the different XML methods provided and their corresponding vulnerable configurations. For all experiments, .NET framework 4.6 was chosen.</p>

That is, it was not possible to display folder contents but the complete file name and path had to be guessed. Due to the lack of a comprehensive website I was forced to gather information from various different sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog post, I want to summarize my findings and focus on the exploitation ofÂ  this kind of vulnerability.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cross-Site Scripting Attacks with adverse Conditions: Upper-Case XSS</title><link>https://soffensive.github.io/posts/web-app-sec/2017-04-05-cross-site-scripting-attacks-with-adverse-conditions-upper-case-xss/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2017 04:03:00 -0700</pubDate><author>soffensive</author><guid>https://soffensive.github.io/posts/web-app-sec/2017-04-05-cross-site-scripting-attacks-with-adverse-conditions-upper-case-xss/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Several times I have encountered web applications that convert
user-provided input to capital letters. For example, the application may
behave as follows:</p>

<p>The injected JavaScript code (after escaping from the quotes, of course) will not be executed in the browser. Why is this the case?  Remember that the HTML tag names themselves, including <code>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</code> are not case-sensitive, whereas the contents inside them are in fact case-sensitive.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
